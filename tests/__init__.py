# This __init__.py file is used to mark the tests directory as a Python package.
# It allows test discovery tools to find and run the tests in this directory.

# You can optionally add code here that sets up common test fixtures or utilities.
# For example:

# import unittest
# from src import some_utility_function

# def setUpModule():
#     # This function will be run once before any tests in this package are run
#     pass

# def tearDownModule():
#     # This function will be run once after all tests in this package have been run
#     pass

# class BaseTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
#     # You can define a base test case with common setup and teardown methods
#     def setUp(self):
#         # This method will be run before each test method
#         pass

#     def tearDown(self):
#         # This method will be run after each test method
#         pass

# For now, we'll keep it empty, allowing for standard test discovery and execution.
