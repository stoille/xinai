# This __init__.py file is used to mark the src directory as a Python package.
# It allows you to import modules from this directory in other parts of your project.

# You can optionally import key functions or classes here to make them directly accessible
# when importing the package. For example:

# from .data_preprocessing import preprocess_data
# from .model_training import train_model
# from .model_evaluation import evaluate_model
# from .interpretability_analysis import analyze_interpretability

# This way, you could use these functions in other parts of your code like this:
# from src import preprocess_data, train_model, evaluate_model, analyze_interpretability

# For now, we'll keep it empty, allowing users to import specific modules as needed.
